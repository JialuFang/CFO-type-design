\usage{
lateonset.simu(phi, p.true, tau, cohortsize, ncohort, accrual, tite.dist, accrual.dist, 
       design, init.dose=1, add.args=list(alp.prior=phi, bet.prior=1-phi), seed=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{phi}{the target DLT rate.}

\item{p.true}{the true DLT rates under the different dose levels.}

\item{tau}{maximal assessment window size.}

\item{cohortsize}{the sample size in each cohort.}

\item{ncohort}{the total number of cohorts.}

\item{accrual}{the accrual rate, i.e., the number of patients accrued in tau time.}

\item{tite.dist}{the distribution of the time to DLT events. \code{tite.dist=1} corresponds to a uniform distribution,
\code{tite.dist=2} corresponds to a Weibull distribution, and \code{tite.dist=3} corresponds to a
log-logistic distribution.}

\item{accrual.dist}{the distribution of the arrival times of patients. When \code{tite.dist=1}, it corresponds to all
patients in each cohort arriving simultaneously at a given accrual rate. When \code{tite.dist=2},
it corresponds to a uniform distribution, and when \code{tite.dist=3}, it corresponds to an
exponential distribution.}

\item{design}{option for selecting different designs, including TITE-CFO, TITE-aCFO, fCFO, f-aCFO, bCFO, and
b-aCFO. Specifically, bCFO refers to the benchmark CFO, and b-aCFO denotes the benchmark aCFO.}

\item{init.dose}{the dose level assigned to the first cohort. The default value \code{init.level} is 1.}

\item{add.args}{additional parameters, usually set as list(alp.prior=phi, bet.prior=1-phi) by default. \code{alp.prior}
and \code{bet.prior} represent the parameters of the prior distribution for the true DLT rate at
any dose level. This prior distribution is specified as Beta( \code{alpha.prior}, \code{beta.prior}).}

\item{seed}{an integer to set as the seed of the random number generator for reproducible results, the default is set to NULL.}
}
\value{
The \code{lateonset.simu()} function returns a list object comprising the following components:
\itemize{
\item{MTD: }{the selected MTD.}
\item{dose.list: }{the list that includes the dose level assigned to each cohort.}
\item{dose.ns: }{the total number of patients for all dose levels.}
\item{DLT.ns: }{the total number of patients for all dose levels}
\item{p.true: }{the actual DLT rates under different dose levels.}
\item{target: }{the target DLT rate.}
\item{total.time: }{the duration of the trial in months.}
\item{DLT.list: }{the DLT outcome observed at each subject.}
\item{enter.times: }{the time at which each subject existing in the trial enters the trial.}
\item{DLT.times: }{the time to DLT for each subject existing in the trial.  If no DLT occurs for a certain subject,
\code{DLT.times} is 0.}

\description{
Use this function to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the CFO-type and aCFO-type designs with late-onset toxicities,
specifically, including Time-to-event CFO (TITE-CFO) design, fractional CFO (fCFO), benchmark CFO, TITE-aCFO design,
the f-aCFO design and benchmark aCFO design.
}
\details{
The \code{lateonset.simu()} function is developed for determining the MTD in a single trial using CFO-type and
aCFO-type designs with late-onset toxicities. Specifically, it includes the TITE-CFO design, fCFO design, benchmark
CFO design, TITE-aCFO design, and f-aCFO design. The \code{design} parameter allows for selecting different designs.
Please note that the results returned by \code{lateonset.simu()} represent a single trial outcome. In practical
applications, multiple simulations are required to ascertain the MTD, and this can be achieved using the
\code{CFO.oc()} function.
